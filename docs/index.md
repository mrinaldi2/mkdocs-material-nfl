### Overview of the NFL

#### History

The NFL began as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) in 1920, adopting its current name in 1922. The league gradually stabilized during the 1920s and 1930s, with notable events like the first championship game in 1933, and reintegration of black players post-World War II. A significant development was the merger with the American Football League in 1960, which led to the creation of the Super Bowl, contributing to the NFL's growth into one of the most popular and financially successful sports leagues in the U.S

#### Teams and Structure

The National Football League (NFL) is structured into 32 teams, equally divided between the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC), each housing 16 teams​. Both the AFC and NFC are further split into four divisions, namely the East, North, South, and West divisions, with each division comprising four teams. This divisional structure facilitates the organization of games during the regular season, as each team plays the others within its division twice annually, once at home and once away​.

The divisional arrangement has undergone changes over time, particularly when teams relocate or when new expansion teams join the league​​. This structure not only organizes the regular season play but also has implications for the postseason, determining which teams advance to the playoffs.

The NFL has a well-defined structure that maintains competitive balance while also honoring traditional rivalries. The divisional and conference alignments play a crucial role in the scheduling of games and the subsequent playoff matchups. The design also allows for the expansion of the league while retaining a level of consistency and familiarity among the teams and their respective fan bases.
